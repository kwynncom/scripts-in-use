# scripts-in-use
scripts I use all the time

iping - Only script in this repo for now.

iping pings both IPv4 and IPv6 until they both succeed within a few seconds of each other, or until max attempts.

Note that as I create the new edition in this repo (2021/07/05 6:35pm EDT / UTC -4), it is not the battle tested version.  That version is several versions 
back in my "code-fragments" repo.
